If you ask me, 2020 wasn’t that bad. If you, on the other hand, ask [25 million Americans](https://www.epi.org/blog/what-the-next-president-inherits-more-than-25-million-workers-are-being-hurt-by-the-coronavirus-downturn/) - it wasn’t that great.

I consider myself (and I told this many times) very lucky because a) I found a new job in a fast-growing startup b) I kept that job c) the startup is still fast-growing.

Thanks to the comfort of a stable job and unshaken health, the slowing down of the world provided me with time and space to sit down and think.

And while thinking, I re-realised that for me, nothing is more important than health and family. These are the two things that, no matter what happens, I won’t cut down my efforts on. And if I do at some point, I’d better have a fucking good reason.

## What's in for 2021?

Here are the things that I want to focus on in the upcoming year:

### Investing

Moving to the UK opened up a myriad of easily accessible investing options. This year I will double down on the efforts to make every penny work and I will be writing about that for sure.

### Bootstrapping

The idea of having a small, yet sustainable internet business that makes me enough to live, travel, support my family, and invest has been a dream of mine for a while. It's a bold goal but I hope that by the end of the year I'll have something that pays me for the coffee, to begin with.

### Studying 

When I graduated from the university, I have told myself that I won't do a master's because, first, it's expensive, second, I don't know what exactly do I want to spend my two years of life on. 

So, instead, I've told myself that I will invent my own degree studying things that I like, and come up with my own schedule. 2.5 years forward, I still haven't done that. 

This year I will fix that and I will start with Data Science. Last year at work showed me that I can't speak data scientists' language and I want to be able to do that.

### Writing

And last but not least, I will write about my successes, failures, and thoughts here, even if nobody is reading.
