It's crazy to think that it has been exactly one year since Kobe Bryant passed away.

Kobe was a phenomenal figure in and out of the court. I would watch each and every of his video, trying to mimic his moves and never skipping to shout "Kobe!" before taking a jump shot. Basketball played a big part in building my character and so did Kobe.

Here is what he taught me about success:

### Show up and success will follow

There are countless stories of people recalling how they would come into the gym earlier than usual and they would see Kobe already soaked in sweat.

It shows that it was no coincidence that Kobe went and won 5 championships. It was all a result of discipline and those little decisions to either nap a little bit more or go and work your ass off for your dream. 

> "I can’t relate to lazy people. We don’t speak the same language. I don’t understand you. I don’t want to understand you."

### Haters are inevitable

Hate comes from people who either envy your success or strongly disagree with your ways. In either case, being hated means you are doing something unusual. Darwin had haters. Newton had haters. Kobe had haters too because what and the way he was doing it at the time was extraordinary. In the end, it did not matter who hated him - his achievements speak for themselves.

> "Haters are a good problem to have. Nobody hates the good ones. They hate the great ones."

### Success requires sacrifice

Time is a finite resource. There is only so much in a day that one can do. Accomplishing something great takes years and years of consistent work. Kobe knew this and he consciously made little sacrifices throughout the years. Family time, being a great friend, a great son, or whatever - all of this often had to go down the priority list for him as it did for everyone whose names are still pronounced to this day.

> “We all can be masters at our craft, but you have to make a choice. What I mean by that is, there are inherent sacrifices that come along with that. Family time, hanging out with friends, being a great friend, being a great son, nephew, whatever the case may be. There are sacrifices that come along with making that decision.”
