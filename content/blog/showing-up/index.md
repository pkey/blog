title: Showing Up

I have missed 4 weeks of the blogging and there are many reasons I could lay down: lack of ideas, moving into a new apartment, busy weeks at work due to moving to a new team and so on. 

All of those are plain old excuses, however.

That is the holy grail of consistency - showing up no matter what. Consistency helps building habits and habits help with being consistent. It works the same the other way around - the less we practice something the easier it gets not to practice.

Why consistency is important? Well, it is because it gets you places. If there is any quality that is common to successful people - it has to be consistency. And consistency is hard.

I don't have much to say today. Just wanted to show up.
