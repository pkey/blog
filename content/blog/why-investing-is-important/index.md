One of my goals this year was to get my investment strategy straight.

Ever since I started earning money I haven't thought much of it. I did play with stocks, crypto, and other fun things but those were small sums and while some of my money was going into savings and pension, most of it I either just set aside without any clear goal or spent on traveling and entertainment. This is not a bad thing at all - money spent on memories and experiences is money spent well.

Essentially, money is a toolkit that you can buy food with, pay for the roof above your head, and many other things you can spend it on but the most valuable thing you can trade money for is time. 
 
Time can earn us things that money can't - love, wisdom, happiness, friendships. It is a finite resource and thus its perceived value increases over time. The older we get, the more we value our time. However, that does not mean its intrinsic value is less now than it will be tomorrow. The value of time is always high. Higher than most people think.

Unfortunately, we can't make money off of fin air. We can't mold time from the time either. The good news - we can make money out of money and the process to do that is called investing.

Investing, as opposed to working, earns you money why you sleep. This means that you don't have to spend any of your invaluable time to get more of it. And the more you have - the more time it can buy you.

That is why investing is one of my main focuses this year. I know that my ability to trade time for money will increase over time but if I won't invest my time in learning how money makes money - I will never escape the rat race.
