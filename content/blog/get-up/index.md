title: Get Up, Paulius

Woke up this morning with a feeling that I don't want to get out of my bed.  It was just too cozy and the world seemed like a big scary mess. 

It is not always like this. Some days we wake up excited and feeling ready to rock. On days like these, we are super productive, creativity flows and it feels like we can conquer the world. I love these days.

However, not all days are made the same. Like today, sometimes you wake up and start the day feeling like total shit. There can be many reasons for that: bad sleep, illness, an argument with your loved one or tiredness from questioning your life too much. Does not matter what the reason is - what matters is that you keep going.

The secret - days like these is when you have to get up and work your ass off. Consistency is what builds and sharpens your character. You can get somewhere by only working when you are feeling good but you won't get far.

So get up and do something.
