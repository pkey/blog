title: Writing is Hard

Writing is hard. Or it is as hard as you make it. I was thinking of what to write and then realised there are many things and at the same time, so few. So I ended up with a conscience flow.

Nothing of a particular interest. This will be a blog post about nothing. I actually don't really like the word "blog post". Article is a shit word too. Let's call it - a writing (not sure if that it is grammatically correct, though)

I must admit that writing is an art. It is also more than that. When I write, it encourages me to think. Writing acts as a catalyst to thoughts and helps connect one thought with the other thus turning abstract ideas, which only exist in my head, into something transferable. Richard Feynman said something along the lines that one can only say he knows something when he can explain it to other human beings in a concise and easily understandable fashion. That is very true. It is that transformation - from an abstract idea to a transferable one - which burns the most calories. 

Anyways, I am willing to burn those calories and will publish something at least once a week.
